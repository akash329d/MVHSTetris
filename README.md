Normal tetris but with multiplayer. Also possible to gain "power-ups" which allow for unique effects on the other player by getting rid of multiple rows at once. Goal is to stay "alive" in Tetris the longest. 

<b>Power Ups: </b><br>
A - Adds a line to the targeted field<br>
C - Clears a line from the targeted field<br>
D - Darkens the targeted field<br>
E - Earthquakes happen in the targeted field<br>
I - Inverts the controls of the targeted player<br>
N - Nukes clear out the targeted field<br>
R - Randomly clears blocks from the targeted field<br>
S - Switches fields with the targeted player<br>
